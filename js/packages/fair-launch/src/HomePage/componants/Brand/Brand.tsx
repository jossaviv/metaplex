                    The Anybodies Project is a community-run lifestyle brand focused on empowering those traditionally not reflected in the industry, specifically marginalized identities including race, sexuality & gender. 9,876 hand-painted collectibles/nfts will serve as your access to the <b>ANYWHERE ISLAND</b>, granting you shared ownership and creative contribution to our brandâ€™s products, accessories and creations.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Anybodies Brand will create & collaborate on clothing products (Sneakers, Hoodies etc.) that are designed to make meaningful impacts to the communities we represent. A great example of this is - creating a non-binary sneaker that is designer for ANYBODY to be comfortable wearing (refer to our Nike x Anybodies AF1).
                    <br /><br /><br />
                    As a verified Anybodies owner, you will have access to Anywhere Island, our collaborative portal on discord. We begin by randomly giving away 1,000 Anybodies x AF 1's to our minting members.
                    <br /><br />
                    Being on the island allows you to define & decide on the products of the Anybodies Brand. Each piece of merchandise will amplify the unique voices of our members, collectively being designed by the Islanders. All our future drops will randomly incorporate our members' NFTs, of which they can collect royalties from in the public sales. Together, the Islanders will vote on what fashion brands and artists the Anybodies Brand will work with in the future.
