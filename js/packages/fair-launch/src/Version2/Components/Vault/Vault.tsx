                    DIAMOND VAULT is your only way of accessing the ANYWHERE ISLAND. We DO NOT want flippers, farmers & short term players to be sitting around the bonfire (AMA), being part of the decision making that has long-term ramifications to our Diamond Handed community.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We plan to grow the Anybodies brand to incredible heights, becoming the a household name for creating & collaborating on products that will exist and be sold in the real world & metaverse. This is why we made the Diamond Vault, to create a powerful like-minded community.
